# 🎯 Map & Mobile Tracker - Campus Ninja for UET Lahore!

Welcome, dear wanderer! You've stumbled upon the ultimate navigation wizard for UET Lahore. Forget aimless wandering and awkward "Where's the library?" questions. With our custom-made campus guide, you'll always find your way, whether it's to the cafeteria, the lecture halls, or that secret chai spot!

## 📜 Project Overview

This ain't your grandma's old paper map! 🚀 It's a high-tech, brainy tracker designed with:

- **Graphs** for smart campus mapping. 📈
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to get you there faster than your snack cravings. 🍔
- **AVL Trees** for ultra-sorted locations (a nerd's paradise!). 🌳
- **Linked Lists** to stalk—uh, track—your every step. 👣
- **Queues and Stacks** to bookmark faves and relive your history. 📚

## 🧠 Why Did We Do This?

- Because getting lost is so last century. 😌
- Because walking in circles isn't cardio. 🏃‍♂️
- Because life’s too short to take the long route. 😎

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Shortest Path Finder:** Speed-run your way through campus. 🏁
- **Location Hierarchies:** See all shops in one go (no peeking required). 🛍️
- **Route Optimization:** For maintenance ninjas and inspection warriors. 🛠️
- **Popular Locations:** Be where the cool crowd is. 🌟
- **Bookmarks:** Favorite your chill spots for quick access. 🧡
- **History Tracker:** Relive your epic adventures—one step at a time. 🎢

## 👩‍💻 Tech Stack (a.k.a. Nerd Fuel)

- **Frontend:** React.js 🤓
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, and the wizardry of algorithms. ✨
- **Mobile App:** React Native (track on the go!) 📱
- **API Testing:** Postman—because we like to double-check stuff. ✔️

## 🛤️ How It Works

1. Open the app. (Easy, right?) 😌
2. Search your destination—cafeteria, library, or maybe just the parking lot. 🅿️
3. Let the algorithms work their magic. 💫
4. Follow the route like a boss. 😎



## 🔮 Future Spells & Potions

- **Dynamic Map Updates:** Because new buildings pop up like mushrooms! 🏗️
- **Real-Time Traffic:** Dodge the crowds like a pro. 🕺
- **Voice Navigation:** Because who needs eyes when you've got ears? 🎧
- **Dedicated Mobile Apps:** Take the magic to Android and iOS. 📲

### Process Explanation:
- For the **Backend (Server)**: It starts the backend by installing dependencies and running the server with Node.js.
- For the **Frontend (Client)**: It installs dependencies and runs the React app.
- For **React Native App (Using Expo Go)**: It uses Expo Go for an easy way to run the React Native app on your mobile device.
